transcription-guidelines: >-
  Not a graphetic/"allographetique" transcription but rather a graphemic one
  that preserves the sequence of letters and reduces each form to its meaning in
  an alphabetical system. Abbreviations are preserved (e.g. pro, pre, tironian
  et, "est" etc.), as well as abbreviative signs, ligatures are reduced to their
  component letters. Spaces between letters reproduce the original (e.g. in the
  case of a semicontinuous script). Punctuations are simplified, reducing to ":"
  all two-component punctuation (e.g. punctus elevatus). Rare characters have
  been preserved such as "instans" and metric values (e.g. ounces).
